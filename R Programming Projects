High value customers identification for an E-Commerce company

A UK-based online retail store has captured the sales data for different products for the period of one year
(Nov 2016 to Dec 2017).The organization wants to roll out a loyalty program to the high-value customers after
identification of segments.For indentification of high value customers, I have created a RFM (Receny,
Frequency, Monetary) matrix. For grouping of the customer segments, I have used two types of clustering
techniques (K means and Hierarchical) and provided a summary for each method alongwith clustering
graphics.

Hiearchical Clustering Results :

HERE,IN THE RESULTS WE CAN CLEARLY SEE THAT GROUP 4 HAS THE LOWEST RECENCY,
HIGHEST FREQUENCY AND HIGHEST MONETARY VALUE. THUS, GROUP 4 MEMBERS ARE THE
HIGHLY VALUABLE CUSTOMERS.
ALSO, GROUP 1 MEMBERS HAVE DECENTLY LOW RECENCY BUT THEY ARE LESS FREQUENT
AND HAVE A COMPARITIVELY LOW MONETARY VALUE THAN GROUP 4 SO THEY CAN
POTENTIALLY BE CATOGORIZED AS THE AVERAGE OR MID VALUED CUSTOMERS.
IT CAN BE NOTED THAT MEMBERS OF GROUP 3 WHICH HAVE HIGH RECENCY, LOW
FREQUENCY AND A LOW MONETARY VALUE BUT THEY HAVE LESS RECENCY AS COMPARED
TO GROUP 4 AND THUS CAN BE CONSIDERED AS LOW VALUED CUSTOMERS.
IT CAN BE NOTED THAT MEMBERS OF GROUP 2 WHICH HAVE HIGHEST RECENCY, LOW
FREQUENCY AND A LOW MONETARY VALUE AND THUS CAN BE CONSIDERED AS A GROUP OF
LOST OR RATHER INACTIVE CUSTOMERS.
SO, IN TOTAL WE HAVE 272 HIGH VALUED CUSTOMERS, 2644 AVERAGE OR MID VALUED
CUSTOMERS , 892 LOW VALUED CUSTOMERS AND 474 LOST CUSTUMERS.

K Means Clustering Results:

HERE,IN THE RESULTS WE CAN CLEARLY SEE THAT GROUP 1 HAS THE LOWEST RECENCY,
HIGHEST FREQUENCY AND HIGHEST MONETARY VALUE. THUS, GROUP 1 MEMBERS ARE THE
HIGHLY VALUABLE CUSTOMERS.
ALSO, GROUP 2 MEMBERS HAVE DECENTLY LOW RECENCY BUT THEY ARE LESS FREQUENT
AND HAVE A LOW MONETARY VALUE SO THEY CAN POTENTIALLY BE CALLED AS AVERAGE OR
MID VALUED CUSTOMERS.
IT CAN BE NOTED THAT MEMBERS OF GROUP 3 HAVE HIGH RECENCY, LOW FREQUENCY AND
A LOW MONETARY VALUE BUT THEY HAVE LESS RECENCY AS COMPARED TO GROUP 4 AND
THUS CAN BE CONSIDERED AS LOW VALUED CUSTOMERS.
IT CAN BE NOTED THAT MEMBERS OF GROUP 4 HAVE HIGHEST RECENCY, LOW FREQUENCY
AND A LOW MONETARY VALUE AND THUS CAN BE CONSIDERED AS A GROUP OF INACTIVE
CUSTOMERS.
SO, IN TOTAL WE HAVE ONLY 10 HIGH VALUED CUSTOMERS, 267 AVERAGE OR MID VALUED
CUSTOMERS , 2946 LOW VALUED CUSTOMERS AND 1059 INACTIVE CUSTUMERS.
